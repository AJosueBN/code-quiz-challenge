//declare variable and do the localstorage get item
//get the id of the div you want to display the scores in
//create a for loop and loop through the variable assigned to the get item
//inside the for loop create the elements of the listwhere you will display the results
// use textContent to add the initiaals and score to it
//append these created elements to the htlm id you got above.


//remeber that what you are retriveing is an object
//so to do the textcontet it has to be varname(from the top where you get item).initials +  varname(from the top where you get item).score
